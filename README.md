# 🔧 Changes in This Fork

### New Features

| Feature | Description | Parameter / Node |
|---|---|---|
| 📂 **Local model scan** | All `.pth/.pt/.safetensors/.bin` under `models/SDMatte/` automatically appear in the `ckpt_name` dropdown. Just drop the file in and refresh the page — no code edits needed. | `ckpt_name` |
| 💾 **Keep model loaded** | Caches the model instance so the second run skips reloading. | `keep_model_loaded` |
| 🔀 **Precision toggle** | Switch between fp32 / fp16 for VRAM vs. stability. | `use_fp16` |
| 🧹 **VRAM cleanup node** | Drop it anywhere in the workflow. **Whenever it executes, it frees SDMatte's VRAM.** | Node: `清理SDMatte显存` |
| 🖼️ **Batch input** | Multiple images + 1 trimap → trimap is broadcast automatically. | automatic |
| 📐 **Trimap shape compatibility** | Accepts `[H,W]` / `[B,H,W]` / `[B,1,H,W]`. | automatic |
| 📥 **Local-first loading** | Use local file if present; only download when missing. | `download_model` |
| 📝 **Better error messages** | Missing files print the exact path they should be placed at. | error output |

### Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **VRAM doubling** — old cache is now cleared when toggling `keep_model_loaded`
- 🐛 **Batch mismatch** — fixed `Expected size N but got size 1` when using multiple images with one trimap
- 🐛 **Shape error** — fixed `too many indices for tensor of dimension 3` when trimap is 4D
- 🐛 **Path detection** — Windows absolute paths were mistakenly treated as HuggingFace repo IDs

### Unchanged

- Model architecture (`src/modeling/SDMatte/meta_arch.py`) is untouched
- All original inputs/outputs/behaviors remain identical with default parameters

## 📌 Quick Start (This Fork)

### Install

1. Place the plugin under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
2. Prepare the **config files** for Stable Diffusion 2.1 base at `ComfyUI/models/diffusers/stable-diffusion-2-1-base/` (see original README, step 3)
3. **Drop your SDMatte weights into `ComfyUI/models/SDMatte/`** (any `.pth` / `.safetensors`)
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Basic Usage

1. Add the `Apply SDMatte` node
2. Pick your model from the `ckpt_name` dropdown
3. Connect `image` and `trimap`
4. Run
5. **To auto-free VRAM after each run** → append a `清理SDMatte显存` node at the end of the workflow

### Recommended Settings

- **Fastest**: `keep_model_loaded=True` + `use_fp16=True` + `inference_size=768`
- **Cleanest**: `inference_size=1024` + `trimap_constraint=0.5~0.6` + accurate trimap
- **Low VRAM**: `keep_model_loaded=False` + `use_fp16=True`
- **Batch**: connect N images to `image`, 1 trimap to `trimap` — broadcast is automatic

> 🔧 **Example Workflow**: [Superior Image Cropping and Mask Refinement Workflow](https://www.runninghub.ai/post/1955928733028941826)  
> 💡 **Recommended**: Watch the video tutorial first to understand the usage, then download the workflow for practice

## 📖 Introduction

SDMatte is an interactive image matting method based on Stable Diffusion, developed by the vivo Camera Research team and accepted by ICCV 2025. This method leverages the powerful priors of pre-trained diffusion models and supports multiple visual prompts (points, boxes, masks) for accurately extracting target objects from natural images.

This plugin integrates SDMatte into ComfyUI, providing a simple and easy-to-use node interface focused on trimap-guided matting functionality with built-in VRAM optimization strategies.

## 🖼️ Examples

### Matting Results

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **High-Precision Matting**: Based on powerful diffusion model priors, capable of handling complex edge details
- 🖼️ **Trimap Guidance**: Supports trimap-guided precise matting
- 🚀 **VRAM Optimization**: Built-in mixed precision, attention slicing, and other memory optimization strategies
- 🔧 **ComfyUI Integration**: Fully compatible with ComfyUI workflow system
- 📥 **Automatic Model Download**: Automatically downloads model weights on first use
- 📱 **Flexible Sizes**: Supports multiple inference resolutions (512-1024px)

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Download Plugin

Place this plugin in the ComfyUI custom nodes directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/flybirdxx/ComfyUI-SDMatte.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

ComfyUI will automatically install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` on startup:

- diffusers
- timm
- einops
- lazyconfig
- safetensors

### 3. Automatic Component Download

**The plugin automatically downloads required config files, no manual action needed.**

SDMatte is built on top of Stable Diffusion 2.1. On first use, it automatically downloads necessary config files from Hugging Face (no model weights):

- Auto-downloads to: `ComfyUI/models/diffusers/stable-diffusion-2-1-base/`
- Downloads only config files: config.json, tokenizer files, etc.
- No large weight files downloaded, saving disk space

If you need to manually download the complete Stable Diffusion 2.1 model:

```bash
# Navigate to diffusers directory
cd ComfyUI/models/diffusers/

# Download Stable Diffusion 2.1 base model
# Method 1: Using huggingface_hub
pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli download stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 --local-dir stable-diffusion-2-1-base

# Method 2: Using git lfs (if installed)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 stable-diffusion-2-1-base
```

### 4. Automatic Model Download

**SDMatte model weights will be downloaded automatically.**

The first time you use the `Apply SDMatte` node, it will automatically check for and download the necessary SDMatte model weights from Hugging Face. The models will be stored in:
`ComfyUI/models/SDMatte/`

You can select between the standard (`SDMatte.safetensors`) and enhanced (`SDMatte_plus.safetensors`) versions directly within the node.

### 4. Restart ComfyUI

Restart ComfyUI to load the new custom nodes.

## 🎮 Usage

### Node Description

#### Apply SDMatte

- **Function**: Loads the model and applies it for matting in a single node.
- **Input**:
  - `ckpt_name`: Select the model to use (`SDMatte.safetensors` or `SDMatte_plus.safetensors`). It will be downloaded automatically if not found.
  - `image`: Input image (ComfyUI IMAGE format)
  - `trimap`: Trimap mask (ComfyUI MASK format)
  - `inference_size`: Inference resolution (512/640/768/896/1024)
  - `is_transparent`: Whether the image contains transparent areas
  - `output_mode`: Output mode (`alpha_only`, `matted_rgba`, `matted_rgb`)
  - `mask_refine`: Enable mask refinement to reduce background interference
  - `trimap_constraint`: Strength of the trimap constraint for refinement
  - `force_cpu`: Force CPU inference (optional)
- **Output**:
  - `alpha_mask`: Alpha mask of the matting result
  - `matted_image`: The matted image result

### Basic Workflow

1. **Load Image**: Load the image that needs matting
2. **Create Trimap**: Use drawing tools or other nodes to create trimap
   - Black (0): Definite background
   - White (1): Definite foreground  
   - Gray (0.5): Unknown region
3. **Apply SDMatte**: Apply matting
4. **Preview Image**: Preview matting result

### Recommended Settings

- **Inference Resolution**: 1024 (highest quality) or 768 (balanced performance)
- **Transparent Flag**: Set according to whether input image has transparent channel
- **Force CPU**: Use only when GPU VRAM is insufficient

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Processing

- **Input Image**: Automatically resized to inference resolution, normalized to [-1, 1]
- **Trimap**: Resized to inference resolution, mapped to [-1, 1] range
- **Output**: Resized back to original resolution, clamped to [0, 1] range

### VRAM Optimization

The plugin has built-in memory optimization strategies (automatically enabled):

- **Mixed Precision**: Uses FP16 autocast to reduce VRAM usage
- **Attention Slicing**: SlicedAttnProcessor(slice_size=1) maximizes VRAM savings
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatically clears CUDA cache before and after inference
- **Device Management**: Smart device allocation and model movement

### Model Loading

- **Weight Formats**: Supports .pth and .safetensors formats
- **Safe Loading**: Handles omegaconf objects, supports weights_only mode
- **Nested Structure**: Automatically handles complex checkpoint structures
